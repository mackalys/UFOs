# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to create a website that will allow people to search for UFO sightings based on date, city, state, country, and shape of the object spotted. A table is then created for the person interacting with to compare the different sightings depending on the different criteria.

## Results
When looking at the website, the UFO enthusiast can enter their desired search based on the criteria listed on the left side of the page. Once the search is entered in the box or boxes, pressing "Enter" will run the search and filter the data displayed on the website. So the data uploaded to the site will all be shown before anything is entered in the boxes and once there is criteria entered, the data shown will show what is specifically asked for.

## Summary
The only issue with this sight is the person must know exactly what they are looking for. Either they would need to go through the data first displayed on the sight or have known prior to accessing the sight. In addition, the data on the website is very limited. It only includes a small sample size and is not a global base.

There are a few changes I would make to the site...

First, I would increase the data provided through the website. With more data, the search may not need to be so specific.

Second, I think an actual location, meaning longitude and latitude, of where the sighting took place. This way, we can insert a map with dots to show where the most sightings took place. The map may also help people witht heir searches so they can get more information based on the areas of high activity.
